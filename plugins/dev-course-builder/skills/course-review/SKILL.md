# Course Review Frameworks

Comprehensive frameworks and checklists for reviewing programming educational content.

## Review Severity Levels

Use these severity levels to prioritize findings:

### Critical (Must Fix)
Issues that make content incorrect, misleading, or harmful to learning:
- Code that doesn't compile or produces wrong output
- Factually incorrect explanations
- Missing critical prerequisites
- Security vulnerabilities in example code
- Misleading simplifications that create misconceptions

### Major (Should Fix)
Issues that significantly impact quality or learning effectiveness:
- Inconsistent terminology or style
- Unclear explanations for target audience
- Missing important edge cases or pitfalls
- Poor progression or scaffolding
- Examples that don't follow best practices

### Minor (Nice to Fix)
Issues that affect polish but not correctness or core learning:
- Typos and grammatical errors
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Suboptimal code style choices
- Missing "nice to have" content
- Verbose or redundant explanations

### Enhancement (Suggestions)
Opportunities to improve beyond current quality:
- Additional examples or analogies
