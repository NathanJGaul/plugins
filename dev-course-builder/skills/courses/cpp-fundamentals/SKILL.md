# C++ Fundamentals - Course Profile

**Course:** C++ Fundamentals for Junior Developers
**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
**Duration:** 12-16 weeks

## Course Overview

A comprehensive introduction to C++ for junior developers who want to deepen their understanding of low-level programming, memory management, and systems-level thinking. This course builds a strong foundation in C++ without relying on frameworks, focusing on the language itself and the standard library.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** Junior developers (1-2 years experience) looking to:
- Understand how programming works "under the hood"
- Learn a systems programming language
- Prepare for performance-critical development
- Build foundations for game development, embedded systems, or systems programming

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic programming experience in any language
- Understanding of variables, functions, loops, conditionals
- Familiarity with using a terminal/command line
- Basic understanding of what compilation means

**Not assumed:**
- Prior C or C++ experience
- Deep understanding of memory management
- Experience with pointers or manual memory management
- Knowledge of object-oriented programming in C++

## Learning Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Build Understanding from the Ground Up**
   - Start with what the computer actually does
   - Show how high-level concepts map to low-level operations
   - Make memory and execution visible through diagrams

2. **Modern C++ First**
   - Teach C++17/20 idioms from the start
   - Introduce smart pointers before raw pointers
   - Use standard library containers before arrays
   - Then show the "old way" to understand legacy code

3. **Compile-Run-Debug Cycle**
   - Every concept demonstrated with compilable code
   - Compiler errors are learning opportunities
   - Debugging is taught explicitly, not assumed

4. **No Framework Dependency**
   - Standard library only (no Boost, Qt, etc.)
   - Focus on language fundamentals
   - Students understand what they're using

5. **Professional Practices Throughout**
   - Version control from day one
   - Testing introduced early
   - Code organization and documentation

## Technical Stack

### Required Tools
- **Compiler:** GCC 11+ or Clang 14+ (support C++20)
- **Build System:** CMake 3.20+
- **Editor/IDE:** VS Code with C/C++ extension (recommended) or CLion
- **Debugger:** GDB or LLDB
- **Version Control:** Git

### Development Environment
- Primary: Local development on Linux, macOS, or WSL2
- Alternative: Compiler Explorer (godbolt.org) for quick experiments
- Testing: Google Test or Catch2 for unit testing

### Standard Library Focus
- `<iostream>` - I/O operations
- `<string>` - String handling
- `<vector>`, `<array>` - Containers
- `<memory>` - Smart pointers
- `<algorithm>` - Standard algorithms
- `<filesystem>` - File operations (C++17)
- `<optional>`, `<variant>` - Modern type handling

## Content Style

### Writing Tone
- Technical but approachable
- Direct and clear explanations
- Acknowledge when things are complex
- Compare to languages students might know (Python, JavaScript)
- Avoid unnecessary jargon, but introduce proper terminology

### Code Examples
- Always complete and compilable
- Include `#include` statements
- Show compilation commands
- Display actual output
- Use consistent formatting (clang-format style)

### Example Code Block Format
```cpp
// filename: example.cpp
// Compile: g++ -std=c++20 -Wall -o example example.cpp
// Run: ./example

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (const auto& n : numbers) {
        std::cout << n << " ";
    }
    std::cout << "\n";

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Diagrams and Visualizations
- Memory layout diagrams for every pointer/reference topic
- Stack vs heap visualizations
- Object lifetime diagrams
- Call stack illustrations during recursion
- Use ASCII art or simple diagrams that work in markdown

### Error Examples
Always show common errors with full compiler output:
```cpp
// Common mistake: using uninitialized variable
int x;
std::cout << x;  // Undefined behavior!
```

**Compiler warning (with -Wall):**
```
warning: 'x' is used uninitialized [-Wuninitialized]
```

## Callout Box Types

Use these throughout content:

**Important:** Critical concept or common mistake
```markdown
> **Important:** Always initialize your variables in C++. Unlike some languages,
> C++ does not automatically initialize local variables to zero.
```

**Why This Matters:** Connect to real-world relevance
```markdown
> **Why This Matters:** Understanding the stack vs heap distinction is crucial
> for writing efficient C++ code and avoiding memory leaks.
```

**Coming From [Language]:** Help students transfer knowledge
```markdown
> **Coming From Python:** Unlike Python lists, C++ vectors store elements
> contiguously in memory, which makes random access O(1) but insertions O(n).
```

**Under the Hood:** Deeper technical explanation
```markdown
> **Under the Hood:** When you call a function, the compiler generates code
> that pushes parameters onto the stack, jumps to the function address, and
> sets up a new stack frame.
```
